# Week 9: Routing Events

## Learning Goals
- Use Choice routers to route messages based on payload content or attributes.
- Apply Scatter-Gather to call multiple flows/services in parallel and merge results.
- Validate incoming requests and handle fallback logic with Validation and Default routes.
- Route based on header values, query parameters, or user roles.

## Business Context
As MuleCart expands, different client applications (admin dashboard, mobile app, affiliate API) require different responses. Youâ€™ll now implement dynamic flow routing and conditional processing based on request context, such as user roles, format type, or even A/B testing scenarios.

## Project Structure

```

## Use Cases & Routing Logic

### 1: Role-Based Routing
- For GET /products/:id, use a Choice router to:
    - Return compact view for anonymous/mobile users
    - Return detailed view for authenticated/admin users
- Simulate role via a custom HTTP header: X-User-Role: admin

### 2: Dynamic Recommendations via Scatter-Gather
- GET /products/:id/recommendations
- Use Scatter-Gather to call:
    - "Related by category"
    - "Frequently bought together"
    - "Trending in this category"
- Merge and return all recommendation types

### 3: API Version Routing
- Route requests to different flows or transformations based on a query parameter: ?v=1 or ?v=2
- Default to latest version if param is missing

### 4: Request Validation
- Use Validation module to enforce that required parameters are present in GET /search?q=...
- Return 400 with a useful message if validation fails

## Workflow
- Create a new catalog-routing-flows.xml to separate routing logic from core data flows.
- In catalog-experience-api.xml, define endpoints that delegate to conditional routers.
- Use Choice, Scatter-Gather, and Validation to control the flow path based on:
    - Header (X-User-Role)
    - Query param (?v=1)
    - Payload content
- Use Transform Message after Scatter-Gather to merge results cleanly.
- Handle default or fallback paths with default otherwise conditions in Choice routers.
- In your README:
    - Show how to simulate different routing paths with curl/Postman
    - Include before/after routing examples
    - Document assumptions (e.g. how roles are determined)
