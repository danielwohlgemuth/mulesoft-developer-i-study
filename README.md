# MuleSoft Developer I Study

**MuleCart** is a fully modular, API-led system for managing a product catalog â€” built with MuleSoft and deployed on CloudHub.

This project is intended to be developed incrementally over 12 weeks as a practical companion to the MuleSoft Developer I certification.

The plan for this project was prepared with ChatGPT using the [exam outline](exam-outline.md) and topics from the trailhead course [Anypoint Platform Development: Fundamentals - DEX401](anypoint-platform-development-fundamentals.md) as inputs.
