# MuleSoft Developer I Study

This study plan was made with the help of ChatGPT using the [exam outline](exam-outline.md) and topics from the trailhead course [Anypoint Platform Development: Fundamentals - DEX401](anypoint-platform-development-fundamentals.md) with the goal of combining the theory with practical projects.

The project that will be built will be an eCommerce API Platform, called MuleCart, for a fictional multi-channel retail company. Each week will focus on a different aspect of the API platform.
