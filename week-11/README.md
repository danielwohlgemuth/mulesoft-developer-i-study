# Week 11: Debugging and Testing with MUnit

## Learning Goals
- Write MUnit tests for individual flows using mocks and assertions.
- Inspect and debug Mule events with logger statements and breakpoints.
- Validate payloads, variables, and attributes in test assertions.
- Use before/after test scaffolding for repeatable test environments.
- Understand how to simulate external services with mocked processors.

## Business Context
MuleCart is beginning to grow its engineering team. To ensure reliability, you need to make the platform testable. This week, youâ€™ll create unit tests for key API flows (e.g., GET /products/:id, GET /products) and simulate error conditions, mocked responses, and validate transformations.

## Use Cases & Test Scenarios

### 1. GET /products/:id (Happy Path)
- MUnit test mocks DB response
- Asserts:
    - HTTP status = 200
    - Payload contains id, name, price
    - Logs expected values at debug level

### 2. GET /products/:id (Not Found)
- Mock DB result as empty
- Asserts:
    - HTTP status = 404
    - Payload contains custom error JSON with PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND

### 3. GET /products (Multiple Products)
- Mock DB to return list
- Asserts:
    - Payload size matches expected
    - Each item matches format (based on DataWeave logic)

### 4. Error Handling
- Simulate a DB connector failure (e.g., raise CONNECTIVITY error)
- Assert that:
    - Global error handler is invoked
    - Response status = 500 with friendly message
    - Log entry includes error trace

### 5. Logging & Debugging
- Add meaningful Logger steps in main flows:
    - Before/after transformation
    - On error
- Use breakpoints in Anypoint Studio to walk through an event during local testing

## Workflow
- Add MUnit dependencies to the project (via pom.xml or Studio UI).
- Create test files inside /src/test/munit/ with:
    - Mock When to replace connector calls
    - Set Event to provide input payloads
    - Assert That to check output
- For each scenario:
    - Simulate input
    - Mock dependencies (e.g. DB, HTTP)
    - Assert final payload or attributes
- In your README:
    - List each test case and what it covers
    - Describe your testing strategy (e.g., unit vs integration scope)
    - Explain how to run tests in Studio or via Maven CLI
